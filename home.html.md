Welcome to monacobro. You might not need to fork VSCode. Monaco is the underlying library that is used at the core of VSCode. It has very powerful primitives, and allows us to build things similar to VSCode but fully web-first.

On this website I'm showcasing some of my UX experiments that I serve as modular templates for building cool new UX experiences based on the monaco editor (https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor).

Please use this as inspiration of what can be done with it. Let's build the future of editing together! Find me [on X](https://x.com/janwilmake)

Please "view source" on any of these pages (its just html, bro) or star it [on GitHub](https://github.com/janwilmake/monacobro)
